# AWS Shield Advanced

---

## What Is The Service

**AWS Shield Advanced** is Amazon’s premium **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** protection service that offers:

- Advanced detection
- Deeper traffic analysis
- 24/7 access to DDoS response experts (Shield Response Team)
- Financial protections against DDoS-related costs

While **Shield Standard** protects all AWS customers automatically at no cost (Layer 3/4 attacks like SYN floods, UDP reflection), **Shield Advanced** provides **extra protections**, **real-time visibility**, and **human expertise** for organizations running high-risk, internet-facing applications.

### Why It Matters

DDoS attacks today aren’t just brute-force floods — they’re **targeted, sophisticated, and financially draining**.

Shield Advanced helps you:
- Prevent outages
- Mitigate attacks in real-time
- Recover with AWS billing support and mitigation expertise

**You should consider Shield Advanced if you're running:**
- Critical APIs, login pages, or transactional systems
- High-visibility public services or customer portals
- Financial services, healthcare, or government apps
- Any workload that absolutely cannot afford downtime

## Cybersecurity Analogy

Imagine you own a building:
- **Shield Standard** = reinforced front door (basic break-in protection)
- **Shield Advanced** =  
  - 24/7 SWAT team  
  - Real-time surveillance cameras  
  - Early-warning alarms  
  - Insurance that refunds damage  
  - Forensics if something does happen  

**Shield Advanced = visibility + intelligence + response + compensation**

## Real-World Analogy

Shield Standard is like basic locks and alarms built into your house.  

Shield Advanced is for **public figures**:
- Private security watching outside
- Alerts if someone circles the block too much
- Insurance to pay for damages
- A full response team if anything happens

It’s the difference between **passive defense** and **actively managed defense**.

## How It Works

Shield Advanced builds on top of Shield Standard and integrates with services like:

- **CloudFront**
- **Route 53**
- **Elastic Load Balancers**
- **AWS Global Accelerator**
- **Elastic IPs for EC2**

### 1. Advanced DDoS Detection & Mitigation (L3–L7)

- Detects volumetric, protocol, and **application-layer attacks**
- Uses **baseline traffic models + anomaly detection**
- Real-time response
- Automatic mitigation or human escalation to **Shield Response Team**

### 2. DDoS Cost Protection

- If an attack spikes your AWS bill (autoscaling, data transfer), **Shield Advanced reimburses those costs**
- Critical for horizontally scaling systems

### 3. Shield Response Team (SRT) – 24/7 Experts

- Open a case to get AWS DDoS experts involved
- They help with:
  - Traffic analysis
  - WAF tuning
  - Real-time mitigation
  - Architecture recommendations

**Response SLA:** Minutes, not hours

### 4. Real-Time Visibility & Diagnostics

- Know when you're under attack
- Attack type (UDP flood, HTTP flood, etc.)
- View packet/request volumes
- Viewable in AWS Console or via **CloudWatch metrics**

### 5. WAF + Firewall Manager Integration

- Push automatic WAF rules during an attack
- Use **Firewall Manager** to manage policies **across accounts**
- Standardize protection for multiple workloads

### 6. Global Threat Environment Dashboard

- Shows global attacks observed across AWS
- Early-warning tool for emerging threats

### 7. Application Layer (L7) Protections via WAF

- Defend against HTTP floods, slow POSTs, app-layer abuses
- Shield Advanced can push WAF rules automatically to mitigate

## Real-Life Example

- Attacker floods public API with fake requests
- Platform auto-scales massively → **thousands in AWS costs**


Because they used Shield Advanced:
- The attack is **detected and mitigated** in real time
- **Shield Response Team** helps fine-tune WAF filters
- **Reimbursement** is requested for traffic spike

- They use **CloudWatch metrics** to improve monitoring

> Result: Minimal downtime, no lost money, better prep for next time.

## Final Thoughts

If you run **business-critical, public-facing, or high-risk workloads**, evaluate AWS Shield Advanced.

It’s not just a DDoS filter:
- It’s a **team**  
- A **billing safety net**  
- A **visibility platform**  
- An **early warning system**


Yes — it’s expensive. But so is **downtime**.

> Shield Advanced turns AWS into your **active partner** in defending availability.

When your backend is melting from packet floods, having **AWS engineers fighting with you** in real time is worth every penny.
