# Amazon CloudFront

---

## What Is the Service (And Why Itâ€™s Important)

**Amazon CloudFront** is AWSâ€™s **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** â€” a globally distributed system that caches and serves content (static or dynamic) close to users to reduce latency and improve speed.

But CloudFront is more than just a performance booster. Itâ€™s a **security perimeter** and strategic **edge control point**:

- Terminates **SSL/TLS** connections
- Blocks malicious traffic via **AWS WAF**
- Enforces **geo-restrictions**
- **Logs** detailed access records
- Serves as the **edge layer** in zero-trust architectures

> CDNs like CloudFront are often the **first layer exposed to the internet**, making them a critical layer for performance, **security posture**, and **incident visibility**.

## Cybersecurity Analogy

Think of your origin servers (S3, EC2, ALB, etc.) as a **secure building**, and CloudFront as a **chain of security gates** in every major city.

Each gate can:
- âœ… Check IDs (auth tokens, headers, IPs)
- âœ… Block bad actors (WAF rules)
- âœ… Allow only guests from specific regions (geo-blocking)
- âœ… Keep an access log

Your building remains **hidden, clean, and protected** â€” while the gates handle the incoming traffic and threats.

## Real-World Analogy

CloudFront is like a **worldwide network of delivery lockers**.

You store your product (video, image, HTML page, API response) in the **closest locker to the customer**.

The customer:
- Gets **faster access**
- Doesnâ€™t wait for **cross-continent delivery**
- Enjoys **secure, auditable delivery**
- Can be **tracked, validated, and blocked** if needed

If something suspicious happens (too many hits from one region, bot traffic, etc.), you can **lock the locker** or **reroute traffic** elsewhere.

## Key Concepts & Flow

### Origins
The original data sources (e.g., S3, ALBs, EC2, custom domains).  
CloudFront **pulls** from the origin and **caches** the content temporarily.

### Edge Locations
600+ global locations that:
- Cache and serve content
- **Terminate SSL**
- **Run WAF rules**
- **Log requests**

### Distributions
Configurations that define:
- Request routing
- Caching behavior
- Logging
- Security settings

### Behaviors and Rules
Per-path configurations that define:
- Which **origin** to use
- Caching strategies
- WAF associations
- Header/query forwarding
- Allowed HTTP methods
- Lambda@Edge or Function@Edge logic

## Pricing Model

CloudFront pricing is **usage-based**:

- **Data Transfer Out**: Charged by GB, region-dependent
- **HTTP/HTTPS Requests**: Priced per 10,000 or per million
- **Invalidation Requests**: First 1,000/month free
- **Real-Time Logs**: Charged per record sent to Kinesis
- **WAF & Shield**: Billed separately (if enabled)

> Example:  
> If your app serves **1 TB/month** + **100k HTTPS requests**:
> - You pay for **data transfer out**
> - You pay for **HTTPS requests**
> - Any log delivery or WAF usage adds to the total

## Real-Life Security Example

**Winterdayâ€™s e-commerce platform** hosts product images in S3 behind CloudFront.  
One night, they notice:

- ðŸ”º Traffic spike from a **single IP in Eastern Europe**
- ðŸ”º All requests go to `/images/private/`
- ðŸ”º User-agent is `curl/7.68.0`
- ðŸ”º 90% of requests fail with **403 errors** (invalid signed URL)

### Their defenses:

- âœ… **CloudFront WAF** blocks rate over 2,000 reqs / 5 min  
- âœ… TLS 1.2+ enforced  
- âœ… IP range blocked  
- âœ… Cached objects invalidated  
- âœ… Signed URL keys rotated  
- âœ… **Lambda@Edge** deployed for deeper token validation  

**Result**: Threat neutralized before it reached the origin.
