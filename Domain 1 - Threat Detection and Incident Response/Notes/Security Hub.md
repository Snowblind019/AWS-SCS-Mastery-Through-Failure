# **AWS Security Hub**

## **What is the service (and why it’s important)**

**AWS Security Hub** is your centralized security dashboard in AWS. It collects and consolidates security findings from multiple AWS services (like **GuardDuty**, **Inspector**, **IAM Access Analyzer**, **Macie**, **Firewall Manager**), third-party tools, and even custom integrations, and presents them in a unified format.

Think of it as the **SIEM-lite for AWS** — it **doesn’t generate logs or detect threats directly** — it **aggregates findings**, **applies security standards**, and **helps you prioritize what to fix**.

It automates **continuous compliance checks** using standards like:

- **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices**
- **CIS AWS Benchmarks**
- **PCI DSS**

It helps security teams answer:

- “**What are the biggest security issues right now?**”
- “**Are we compliant with best practices?**”
- “**Which resources are vulnerable or misconfigured?**”

**Without Security Hub**, you’d be checking each service manually or building your own dashboard. **With it**, you have one place to understand your AWS security posture.

## **Cybersecurity and Real World Analogy**

### **Cybersecurity Analogy**
**Security Hub is like a Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard** inside your cloud account. Instead of **5 different screens** showing **GuardDuty alerts**, **Macie violations**, **IAM misconfigurations**, and **Inspector CVEs** — **Security Hub pulls it all into one view**, **standardizes the format**, **removes duplicates**, and **applies automated security rules** to tell you which problems matter most.

### **Real World Analogy**
Imagine you own a **smart home system** with **10+ sensors**:

- Smoke detector
- Security cameras
- Door sensors
- Thermostats
- Leak sensors

Each one sends alerts — but you don’t want to check **10 apps**.

Instead, you use a **home automation dashboard** that:

- **Collects everything**
- **Flags urgent risks** (like a door left open at night)
- **Suppresses duplicate alerts**
- **Tells you what to do next**

**Security Hub is that for your AWS account.** It’s **not a new sensor**. It’s the **system that orchestrates and makes sense of them all**.

---

## **How it works / what it does**

At its core, **Security Hub does three things**:

### **1) Ingest Findings from Integrated Sources**

**Security Hub pulls in security findings** (alerts, warnings, misconfigurations) from:

- **AWS services:**
  - **GuardDuty** (threat detections)
  - **Inspector** (vulnerabilities in EC2/ECR)
  - **IAM Access Analyzer** (resource exposure)
  - **Macie** (sensitive data exposure)
  - **Firewall Manager** (security group violations)
- **65+ third-party vendors** (CrowdStrike, Trend Micro, Splunk, etc)
- **Custom or in-house tools** via the **BatchImportFindings API**

All findings come in a standardized **AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF)** — a normalized JSON structure with consistent fields like **severity**, **title**, **affected resource**, **remediation**, and **timestamps**.

### **2) Run Automated Compliance Checks (Security Standards)**

**Security Hub** continuously evaluates your environment against security best practices and frameworks. It includes prebuilt standards like:

- **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP)** — AWS-recommended checks
- **CIS AWS Benchmark v1.4.0** — industry-aligned controls
- **PCI DSS v3.2.1** — for payment compliance

These generate findings like:

- “**S3 bucket allows public read**”
- “**IAM user has no MFA**”
- “**CloudTrail not enabled in all regions**”
- “**Security group open to 0.0.0.0/0**”

### **3) Correlate, De-duplicate, Prioritize**

**Security Hub:**

- **De-duplicates** overlapping alerts
- **Groups related findings** (ex: multiple issues on same EC2 instance)
- **Assigns severity levels** (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- **Displays** them in a central dashboard with **sorting**, **filters**, and **export options**

It **doesn’t fix things** — but it **gives you the intel** to know **what to fix** and **which service caused the issue**.

---

## **Pricing Models**

**Security Hub pricing is based on:**

- **Number of ingested security findings**
- **Number of enabled security standards**
- **Region-level usage** (billed separately per region)

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

| **Feature**             | **Price**                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Ingested findings**   | ~**$0.0010 per finding**                  |
| **Security Standards checks** | ~**$0.0010 per check per resource per standard** |
| **30-day free trial**   | **Per region**, includes all features     |

**Cost can add up if:**

- You **ingest high-volume data** from tools like **GuardDuty** or **Inspector**
- You **run multiple standards** across **thousands of resources**

**Tip:** Disable **unused standards** or **limit ingestion** of **low-value findings** if cost is a concern.

---

## **Other Explanations (and Key Points)**

### **Integration with Automation and Response**
**Security Hub findings can be sent to:**

- **CloudWatch Events / EventBridge** — for triggering alerts or **Lambda** responses
- **AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter** — to track as **ops items**
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** systems — like **Splunk**

### **Custom Actions**
You can define **“Custom Actions”** in Security Hub. **Example:**

- “**Quarantine EC2**” → Triggers **Lambda** that detaches instance from VPC
- “**Notify Security Team**” → Sends finding to **Slack/Teams/SNS**

### **Multi-Account and Organization Support**
You can **centralize all findings** across **all AWS accounts** in your organization using **Security Hub’s delegated admin and aggregation features**.

### **Finding Lifecycle**
Each finding has a lifecycle:

- **NEW:** Detected  
- **NOTIFIED:** Sent to SIEM/integration  
- **SUPPRESSED:** Hidden  
- **RESOLVED:** Resource has been fixed  

You can **manage finding state** via **automation** or **manually**.

## **Real Life Example**

Let’s say:

- You have **200 EC2 instances**, some **S3 buckets**, a few **Lambdas**
- One of your devs **mistakenly disables GuardDuty** for a day
- Meanwhile, someone **uploads sensitive data** to an **S3 bucket**
- Another team **opens a security group** to **0.0.0.0/0 port 22**
- A **container vulnerability** is discovered on a production app

**Without Security Hub:**

- You’d have to check **GuardDuty**, **Macie**, **VPC Flow Logs**, **Inspector** separately

**With Security Hub:**

- You **see all 5 issues in one dashboard**
- You see:
  - **S3 bucket flagged by Macie**
  - **EC2 port open flagged by Foundational Best Practices**
  - **Container vulnerability flagged by Inspector**
  - **GuardDuty status flagged by Config + best practices**
- You **sort by CRITICAL** → **fix top ones**
- **Export** as **PDF** or **JSON** to share with security or auditors

It **saves you from alert fatigue**, **dashboard fatigue**, and helps you **prioritize what matters most**.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

**Security Hub is not about detecting threats or patching bugs — it’s about visibility and prioritization.**  
It’s the **glue** between **security services**, **compliance frameworks**, and **operational response**. It **takes raw security findings** and **turns them into actionable insights** that security engineers can act on, without being buried under **10 different dashboards**.

If you’re running a **production AWS environment**, especially **across multiple accounts** — **Security Hub becomes a must-have tool** for **visibility**, **compliance**, and **alert triage**.

It **won’t replace your SIEM** or your team’s **security playbooks**, but it **will feed both of them**, and it’ll do it in a way that’s **AWS-native**, **scalable**, and **deeply integrated** into the fabric of your cloud workloads.
