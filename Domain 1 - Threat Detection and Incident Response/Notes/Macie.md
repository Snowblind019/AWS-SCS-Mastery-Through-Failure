# **AWS Macie**

**Macie** is a data security and privacy service. Its main job is to automatically find and protect sensitive data in your **Amazon S3** buckets, like:

| **Sensitive Data Examples** |
|-----------------------------|
| **Names** |
| **Addresses** |
| **Social Security Numbers (SSN's)** |
| **Credit card numbers** |
| **API keys** |
| **Passwords** |
| **Health data (HIPAA)** |
| **Customer sensitive data** _(defined by me)_ |

**Macie** is honestly a vital service that you'd be better having than not having. Let's say that a company stores thousands of files in hundreds of buckets. Over time, it's highly probable that the engineers will forget:

- **Which of the buckets are public**
- **Do any contain personal data like PII (Personal Identifiable Information)**
- **Are credentials or secrets exposed**

**Macie** helps solve this issue by automatically scanning the **S3** buckets and informing the engineers if it finds any **PII** in the buckets. It sends out a message like:

> “Hey, file **happybirthday.txt** contains **3 names**, **2 credit card numbers**, and **an email**. Also, buckets **snowy**, **winterday**, and **blizzard** are publicly accessible.”

This was just an example, but you can see how it proves to be useful. It automatically keeps tabs on each **S3** bucket so the company can stay in compliance with **PCI-DSS** and **HIPAA** by informing the engineers to fix any violations found.

## **Cybersecurity Analogy**

Amazon has a unique naming convention, so I mostly come up with cybersecurity & real world analogies to remember best. In regards to cybersecurity, **Macie** can be considered a **DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Analyst** for **S3**.

My reasoning for saying this is that in a normal big tech company's **SOC (Security Operations Center)** you have:

- **Thousands of servers (S3 buckets)**
- **Millions of files** _(logs, backups, customer exports, internal docs)_

In these files, you have **NO** idea which files have sensitive stuff in them. Some of them might even be exposed to the internet. So to remediate this issue, the company hires a **DLP analyst** in this example named **Macie**.

It is **Macie's** job to:

1. **Constantly inventory your servers (all S3 buckets)**
2. **Scan files for sensitive data** like:
   - **SSN's, credit cards, emails, access keys**
3. **Flag risky files:**
   - “**This bucket is public, and it contains 30 names and 2 credit card numbers**”
4. **Create alerts** so the **SOC** team knows:
   - **What was found, where it was found, who can access it**
5. **Optionally**, it could tell the automatic engineer _(via **SNS** to **EventBridge** + **Lambda**) to take action_
   - **Remove public access, encrypt the file, notify SecOps**

## **Real-World Analogy**

In a real world analogy, **Macie** is like a security robot of sorts. Like imagine you live in a huge house with **hundreds of rooms (S3 buckets)** and over the years you just thrown all kinds of things in boxes into different rooms like **photos, tax returns, passports, credit cards, love letters, receipts**, and even your **Club Penguin password** from when you were 7 written on a sticky note.

You now are renting this home on **Airbnb** and some rooms are accidentally left unlocked and some are even shared with the guests.

You're worried:

- “**What if someone finds something private?**”
- “**Do I even know where all my sensitive stuff is?**”

So you do what any other person that has a house with hundreds of rooms does, you hire a security robot named **Macie** to look through all the boxes.

**Macie will:**

1. **Walk through the entire house**
2. **Check which rooms are locked and which are unlocked to the public**
3. **Opens every box and scans it for sensitive stuff:**

| **Sensitive Stuff in Boxes** |
|------------------------------|
| **Birth Certificates** |
| **Credit Cards** |
| **Love letters** |
| **Bank statements** |
| **Passports** |
| **Club Penguin password** |

4. **When it finds something important it informs you**
   - “**This room is unlocked and contains a box with your SSN, love letter to Roxy, and Club Penguin password.**”
5. **Instead of telling you in person it puts all this information on a dashboard for easy viewing**
6. **You can safeguard your things** by automating the process by having the doors **auto-lock**, the boxes be **hidden**, and you get **notified** whenever **Macie** finds anything risky.

## **How Macie Works**

1. **It checks all buckets** in your AWS account and notes which ones are **public, encrypted, or shared** with other accounts
2. **It uses Machine Learning and pattern matching** to identify sensitive data inside the objects (files) in the buckets and tells you
   - **What sensitive data it found**
   - **Which bucket it's in**
   - **How many times it appeared**
   - **What type it is** _(SSN, name, key, etc.)_
   - **If the bucket is public or private**
3. **Creates findings (Alerts)**
   - **Macie** reports anything risky it finds as a **finding**, which you can:
     - **View** in the **Macie** console
     - **Sent** to **Security Hub**, **EventBridge**, or **SNS**
     - **Use** to trigger automation

## **Macie Looks for Predefined Sensitive Data Types**

| **Category:** | **Examples:** |
|---|---|
| **PII** | **Name, Email, Address, SSN, Passport** |
| **Financial** | **Credit card numbers, IBAN, SWIFT, Bank ID** |
| **Credentials** | **Access keys, secret keys, API keys, passwords** |
| **Healthcare** | **Health Insurance ID, Medicare number, ICD codes** |
| **Custom** | **You can define custom matchers or regex** |

## **The Process to Enabling and Using Macie Is as Follows**

1. **Enable Macie** in your AWS region _(simple one-click)_.
2. **Macie automatically discovers** all **S3** buckets.
3. **You choose** which buckets to scan.
4. **Macie scans** the objects (files) inside.
5. **It classifies data and creates findings.**
6. **You review those findings and take action.**

## **What Findings Look Like**

This is what findings look like and contain:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **Resource** | the S3 bucket or object |
| **Sensitive types** | “**CreditCardNumber**”, “**Name**”, “**Email**” |
| **Count** | how many times each was found |
| **Object path** | where it was found _(bucket/object key)_ |
| **Permissions** | is the object **public** or **shared**? |
| **Timestamps** | when it was created and discovered |
| **Remediation tips** | e.g. “**Encrypt this object**” or “**Make this bucket private**” |

You can respond to a finding by:

- **Viewing** it in the **Macie** console
- **Sending** it to
  - **Security Hub** — centralize with other findings

  - **SNS** — get notified by email/SMS
- **Manually reviewing** it and

  - **Deleting** the file
  - **Restricting** bucket permissions
  - **Adding encryption**

## **Pricing Model**

**Macie's** pricing model is as follows:

| **Feature** | **Cost Type** |
|---|---|
| **Bucket Inventory** | **Per bucket, per month** |
| **Object Scanning** | **Per GB of content scanned** |

An important note is that it **doesn't scan all S3 objects by default**, you control what buckets and how often it scans.

## **Final Thoughts**

**AWS Macie** quietly protects one of your biggest blind spots: **sensitive data in S3**. It's not flashy, but it's very essential, giving you **clarity, control**, and **peace of mind** in a space where mistakes are costly.
