# S3 Access Logs  

## What Is It

Amazon S3 Access Logs record every request made to an S3 bucket. They give you a detailed history of access activity, including:

- Who accessed the bucket  
- Which object they requested  
- What action they took (GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.)  
- The time, IP address, and response  

They’re crucial for **security**, **compliance**, **auditing**, and **troubleshooting**.

Without S3 Access Logs, your bucket might be a black hole — you know files are in there, but not who’s poking around or downloading them.

You can configure one bucket (the **target**) to receive logs from other **source buckets**. The logs are stored as text files, often in hourly batches, with each line representing one access event.

These logs are **not the same as CloudTrail**, which captures control plane actions (like `PutBucketPolicy`).  
**S3 Access Logs capture the data plane**: actual object-level actions like `GET /file.pdf`.

## Cybersecurity Analogy

Think of your S3 bucket as a **file room** in a secure building.

- **CloudTrail** watches who unlocks the door to the room, or who installs new locks (permissions, policies, ACL changes).  
- **S3 Access Logs** watch who enters the room, what folder they open, and what files they copy or delete.

Without S3 Access Logs, someone could walk in, grab sensitive data, and walk out — and you’d have no trace.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a hotel with thousands of rooms (S3 objects).  
**CloudTrail** is like the system that logs who books a room or changes their reservation.  
But **S3 Access Logs** are like **surveillance footage** of who enters which room, at what time, and what they do inside.

Did someone open the minibar? Steal a towel?  
You won’t know unless you’ve got access logging turned on.

## How It Works

You enable access logging **per bucket** by specifying:

- A **target bucket** (where logs will be stored)  
- A **prefix** (to help organize logs)

### The Logs Are:

- Written in plain text  
- Delivered to the target bucket as `.log` files  
- Partitioned by time  
- Each log entry = one access request  

---

### Log Entry Format (Simplified)

```text
bucket-owner bucket [datetime] remote-ip requester-id request-id operation key request-uri http-status error-code bytes-sent object-size total-time turn-around-time referrer user-agent version-id
```

**Example:**

```text
79a3e7... my-bucket [18/Sep/2025:12:34:56 +0000] 198.51.100.1 arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/snowy 3E57427F3EXAMPLE REST.GET.OBJECT logs/2025/09/report.pdf "GET /logs/2025/09/report.pdf HTTP/1.1" 200 - 15243 15243 27 26 "-" "aws-cli/2.13.1"
```

**This Tells You:**

- Who accessed the file (**Snowy**, via IAM)  
- What they accessed (`report.pdf`)  
- When they accessed it (Sept 18, 2025, 12:34 UTC)  
- How they accessed it (AWS CLI, IP `198.51.100.1`)  
- Whether it was successful (`HTTP 200`)

## What You Can Use It For

| Use Case                     | Details                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Detecting data exfiltration  | Unusual number of GETs from external IPs or IAM roles                  |
| Auditing access to sensitive files | Who accessed confidential documents, when, and how               |
| Troubleshooting permissions  | Track failed access attempts (403s, 404s)                               |
| Billing optimization         | Analyze access patterns to reduce unnecessary storage or data transfer |
| Forensic reconstruction      | Reconstruct timeline of actions taken during or before an incident     |
| MFA enforcement monitoring   | Identify users accessing data without MFA, if logged via user-agent/IP |

## CloudTrail vs S3 Access Logs

| Feature             | CloudTrail                                           | S3 Access Logs                                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Logs control plane? | Yes (bucket creation, policy changes)               | No                                                   |
| Logs data plane?    | Only if enabled & for read APIs                     | Yes (object-level actions like GET, PUT)            |
| Granularity         | IAM-level                                           | Object-level                                         |
| Cost                | Free (control plane), storage cost                  | Free, just pay for storage of logs                  |
| Delivery latency    | Minutes                                             | Hours                                                |

## Important Notes

- Access logging is **not retroactive** — you only see access **after it’s enabled**  
- Target bucket must be in **same region** as source bucket  
- Avoid logging to the **same bucket** you're logging — you’ll get **recursive logs**  
- Compression is not enabled — use **lifecycle rules** to transition to Glacier or Deep Archive  

---

## Best Practices

### Log to a Dedicated Logging Bucket

- Create a separate bucket like `s3-access-logs-prod`  
- Give source buckets permission to write to it  
- Prevent deletion/modification with **Object Locking** and **versioning**  

---

### Organize With Prefixes

- Use prefixes like `/logs/{bucket-name}/` to keep logs organized by source  

---

### Enable Lifecycle Rules

- After 30 days → move to **Glacier**  
- After 90+ days → **delete** or move to **Deep Archive**  

---

### Combine With Athena or CloudWatch Logs

- Use **Athena** to query logs via SQL  
- Or stream them into **CloudWatch Logs** or a **SIEM**

---

### Correlate With CloudTrail

- **CloudTrail** shows **bucket-level actions**  
- **S3 Access Logs** show **object-level activity**

---

## Security Monitoring Examples

| Indicator                        | What It Might Mean                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| High volume of GETs from one IP  | Possible automated scraping or exfiltration             |
| 403 Forbidden errors for valid users | Permissions misconfiguration or brute force attempt |
| PUT/DELETE from unexpected principals | Insider threat or credential compromise           |
| Downloads of sensitive objects   | Policy bypass, lack of encryption, or no MFA enforced   |

---

## Retention and Compliance

Because these logs are about **data access**, they may fall under compliance requirements like:

- **HIPAA** (audit logging of PHI)  
- **PCI DSS** (access logs of cardholder data)  
- **SOX** (audit trails for financial records)  

Retention periods typically range from **90 days to 7 years**, depending on your industry.

## Final Thoughts

**S3 Access Logs are like the raw security camera footage** of your object storage.

They aren’t flashy.  
They’re not structured JSON.  
But they **tell the truth** about who touched your data, and when.

And in the aftermath of a breach — or a compliance audit — that truth is everything.

- If you don’t enable them, **you’re blind**.  
- If you don’t store them, **you’re forgetful**.  
- If you don’t analyze them, **you’re wasting their power**.  

**S3 is cheap. Attacks are not.**  
**Log the access. Store the logs. Learn the patterns.**

Because when data leaves your bucket, the log may be the only trail left behind.
